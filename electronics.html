                <p>Also called free running or self-triggering mode does not have any stable state and it has 2 quasi stable state (HIGH and LOW). </p>
                
                <h2>How it Works?</h2>
                    <p>It automatically interchanges between 2 states on a particular interval generating a rectangular waveform which makes the LED blink.
                    <br>Time duration output of HIGH and LOW is determinded by R and C values which makes the LEDs blink faster or slower.
                    <br>Works as a oscillator circuit, in which output oscillate at a particular frequency and generate pulses in rectangular wave form.</p>

                <h2>But first, What is TinkerCAD?</h2>

                <h2>Lets get Started!</h2>
                <p>First you need to create a TinkerCAD account, go ahead and sign up!</p>
                <p>You will then be brought to the dashboard, click into circuit and create new design</p>
                <p>You now have a blank canvas to start designing the circuit.</p>
                <p>Click on the breadboard and move it into the canvas. You can name your breadboard if you want.</p>
                <p>In the search bar search for 555 timer and place it into the breadboard.</p>
                <p>We want to put in the <span>VCC</span> and GND points first so get a black wire to represent GND and <span>red to represent VCC</span>.</p>
                <p>If you hover over the breadboard you can see <span>red boxes</span> showing where connect the wires and how the wires will be connected by the light green line. Click on the hole that you want to place and connect the GND black wire to the - symbol. do the same with the <span>VCC red wire</span> to the + symbol.</p>
                <p>You will need a power supply to supply power to your circuit so search for the power supply and place it into your circuit. Voltage: 5V, Current 2A and connect the VCC and GND connections to the breadboard. <span>DO NOT PLACE THE VCC AND GND WRONGLY YOU MIGHT BURN THE 555 TIMER CAUSING IT TO BE UNUSABLE.</span></p>
                <p>Then get a oscilloscope and place it into your circuit to be able to see the waveform.</p>
                <ul class="timer-components-list">
                    <p>Prepare the other components you need for the circuit</p>
                    <li class="timer-components">
                        1 - Polarised Capacitor
                    </li>
                    <li class="timer-components">
                        1 - Ceramic Capacitor
                    </li>
                    <li class="timer-components">
                        1 - LED
                    </li>
                    <li class="timer-components">
                        1 - 100Kohm Resistor
                    </li>
                    <li class="timer-components">
                        1 - 220ohm Resistor
                    </li>
                    <li class="timer-components">
                        1 - 1Kohm Resistor
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>Using the schematic diagram as reference connect the components with wires in the bread board.</p>
                <p>Connect the oscilloscope <span>Positive side to R3</span> and Negative side to the GND.</p>
                <p>Then play the simulator to see if its working correctly and your done!</p>
