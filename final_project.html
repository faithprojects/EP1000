                    <h2>My Project Idea</h2>
                    <p>I came up with an idea for making a light box coding timer which will help you to be motivated to do coding by having a laser cut box with letters that will light up using the neopixels which is the progress bar of the day and push buttons as a reset button and preset timings for how long you want to study for the day.</p>

                    <p>But after seeking advice from Mr Willie, I decided to change it up to make it more to motivation for studying and productivity for students instead of coding for engineering students. I have also changed the design to make a nanoleaf inspired study timer using each nanolight blocks as the progress bar of the day the nanolight blocks are modular so you are able to move it around to make different patterns and are all connected by small connectors and displaying colorful lights using the neopixels while the push buttons are preset timings for how long do you want to study for the day and a reset button.</p>

                    <h2>Electronics</h2>
                    <h3>Circuit diagram in TinkerCAD</h3>
                    <p>I tested my circuit on TinkerCAD before using the actual components just to make sure it works and so that I don't accidentally burn the actual components. From the circuit diagram, the Din of the neopixel is connected to pin 8 and the 4 push buttons are connected to pins 7, 6, 5, 4 respectively.</p>
                    <img src="images/final_images/tinkercad_circuit.png" alt="circuit diagram" class="heightimg-200px" >


                    <h3>Testing actual circuit</h3>
                    <p>After testing my circuit in TinkerCAD I went on to translate it into the actual breadboard and it worked successfully. I then begin to solder the necessary components needed for my project like the buttons and the neopixel.</p>
                    <img src="images/final_images/working_circuit.jpg" alt="working circuit" class="heightimg-250px" >


                    <p>For the buttons, I used 2 wires each for each button one for VCC (RED) and the other is GND or the  input (wire color is represented with the color of the button) that will be connected to the pins of the arduino later from the breadboard. I didn't have a hard time soldering it as it was quite an easy process.</p>
                    <img src="images/final_images/solderedbuttons.jpg" alt="soldered Buttons" class="heightimg-250px" >

                    <p>For the neopixels, this was abit challenging to solder as I have never soldered neopixels before and afraid of putting too much heat on to the neopixel which might end up burning the neopixel. It took a long process as the wires I used were dupoint cables and had to take note which side the female and male dupoint cables are gonna be placed. The female and male dupoint cables are also of different lengths which I made the male dupoint cables longer than the female dupoint cables so that when trying to connect the cables one cable to another it would be able to reach to the other end of the cable and cable management later wont be too messy with too many long cables so I just had the male dupoints cables longer than female dupoint cables.</p> 
                    
                    <p>I messed up the neopixel a few times cuz I couldn't get the wire to solder on properly onto the neopixel strip and it would break off after I soldered it. It took a few tries but I managed to get 4 strips of neopixel soldered properly and using a heatshrink tubing to keep them in place. I have also used masking tape to line up the wires correctly so that I know which is the input, VCC and GND so that I don't accidentally short the wires when testing and indicated the GND using a black permanent marker so that is easy to identify.</p>

                    <h2>Fusion360: Testing pieces</h2>

                    <h3>Slots & connectors</h3>
                    <p>I test modelled a Slot and connector to see how well it would be able to slide in and out and lock together so that i could use the design to put into my Nanolight Box.</p>
                    <h3>Screw Hole</h3>
                    <p>I also tested the screw hole to make sure it was the right fit and able to screw in and out for the Nanolight Box too.</p>

                    <h2>Fusion360: Nanolight box</h2>
                    <p>Using Fusion360, I modelled the Nanolight box wheree the neopixels will be placed. It has 3 parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Back lid: Which is where the neopixel will be attached to and where there is some cable management on the outside of the backlid there is also holes for the screw to be inserted later on when screwing it together with the box.</li>
                        <li>Box: Where there are screw holes to be able to screw in the back lid and where three forths of the box will be using a transparent filament to be able to diffuse the light from the neopixels and the other one forth is using white fiament.</li>
                        <li>Front lid: Where we will be using a translucent acrylic to help diffuse the light from the neopixels. Initally it is connected to the box but I decided to separate it because the print time was too long and it was a more reasonable to separate it from the Box.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Fusion360: Stand Box</h2>
                    <p>Using fusion 360, I modelled the stand box which is where the buttons will be and where it will house the arduino and breadboard. One side of the box will have holes for the wire to connect to the breadboard and holes for the buttons and another side of the box will have a hole for to be able to connect the arduino to my power bank or my computer so that I can still edit code and power the arduino.</p>

                    <h2>(Add on) Fusion360: Connector Storage</h2>
                    <p>So after assembing the stand box and printing the connectors, I realized that i dont have a storage space for the connectors to be placed if there are extra connectors or connectors that are unused so i modelled a very simple bracket that will later on be glued and placed inside the stand box at one corner.</p>

                    <p>My Home printer, the Ender 3 V2 printer was able to print the box halfway and be able to change filament so I first printed it in transparent filament which as it's printing turns into a translucent print and after it's done printing that, I changed the filament to white filament at the end of it where the screws are. I printed 4 Nanolight boxes.</p>

                    <p>Once the print was done, I tested out the screws to see if it would fit properly and be able to screw in without any breaking or it being too loose of a fit. But it was a good fit and the screws were able to hold themselves well and tight.</p>

                    <h3>Back Lid</h3>
                    <p>Here are the settings that I used:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Supports: On (Everywhere)</li>
                        <li>Infill: 10%</li>
                        <li>Speed: 60mm/s</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I had to reprint the lid 3 times before I got it right because the cable management bar was too brittle and thin and it kept breaking whenever I was trying to remove the supports.I also forgot to make the thickness where the screw holes are abit thinner as they were too tall for the screw to fit and it wont be able to screw together with the nanolight box. So I went back onto Fusion360 to make the bar thicker and fix the thickness and finally on the third try it was strong enough to not break anymore and it was the right thickness.</p>

                    <p>I ran out of light grey filament for one of the lids so I had to print it in a different grey color filament instead in school.</p>

                    <h3>Connectors</h3>
                    <p>Here are the settings that I used:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Infill: 10%</li>
                        <li>Speed: 60mm/s</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After the successful test prints of the connectors, I went back to fusion, and made the connectors abit longer about 35mm long to be able to hold the boxes better when they are stacked or combined. I printed 4 connectors but you can print more depending on how many Nanolight boxes you have.</p>

                    <h3>Connector Storage</h3>
                    <p>Here are the settings that I used:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Infill: 10%</li>
                        <li>Speed: 60mm/s</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Connector Storage turned out great.</p>

                    <h3>Nanolight Box</h3>
                    <p>I first tested one box to put the acrylic together with the box using 90 min epoxy glue for a stronger bond and to see if it has any reaction to epoxy glue as i have never used epoxy with acrylic before. I first sanded the surfaces for a better bond on the acrylic and box and clean the dust away. then i mixed the 2 part epoxy and quickly applied onto the box as the epoxy has a working time of 3-4mins. then i placed the acrylic on top of the 3d printed box making sure that the acrylic is aligned with the box, this was a tough process as the acrylic kept sliding around and it was abit messy to try and align it together.</p>
